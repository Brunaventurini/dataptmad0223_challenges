ðŸ“Š Data Project README

This repository contains a data project focused on analyzing and visualizing the most commonly used names in the United States of America (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ USA) from 2011 to 2019. The project involves scraping, cleaning, and analyzing a database and creating interactive Tableau dashboards to present the findings. The database is organized by year, ethnicity, name, and gender.
ðŸ“š Data Sources

The data used in this project was collected from multiple sources, including public records and official databases. The information includes the most popular names given to newborns in the USA between 2011 and 2019. The dataset is divided into various categories, including year, ethnicity, name, and gender. The specific sources used for data collection are outlined in the data_sources.md file.
ðŸ”„ Data Processing

The data went through a series of processing steps to prepare it for analysis and visualization. The steps include:

    Scraping: Data was collected from public records and official databases using web scraping techniques. The scraping process ensured that a comprehensive dataset was obtained for analysis.

    Cleaning: The scraped data underwent a thorough cleaning process to handle missing values, standardize formats, and remove any inconsistencies or errors. This step involved data transformation, deduplication, and validation to ensure data integrity.

    Analysis: Various analytical techniques were applied to the cleaned dataset to identify the most commonly used names. The analysis focused on aggregating the data by year, ethnicity, and gender and determining the frequency of occurrence for each name within these categories.

ðŸ“Š Tableau Dashboards

The main outcome of this project is a collection of interactive Tableau dashboards that allow users to explore and visualize the most popular names used in the USA from 2011 to 2019. The dashboards provide insights into the most common names for each gender and ethnicity over the years.

To access and explore the dashboards, please follow these steps:

    Install Tableau Desktop or use Tableau Public (free version) on your local machine.

    Clone or download this repository to your computer.

    Open Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public and import the provided dataset (names_dataset.csv).

    Load the dataset into Tableau and explore the various worksheets and dashboards created.

    Interact with the dashboards to filter the data by year, ethnicity, and gender and observe the trends and popularity of names over time.
